# Development data

* dev.fr contains the development sentences in French
* dev.en contains the development sentences in English

These files are aligned at the sentence level, that is, the i-th line in dev.fr is a French translation of the English sentence in the i-th line of dev.en.

* dev.naacl contains manual word alignments for the sentences in the development set.

Manual alignments are specified one link per line in the following format

```
LINE EID FID TYPE PROB
```

where 

* LINE is the line number (starting from 1) that addresses the sentence pair
* EID is the 1-based position in the English sentence 
* FID is the 1-based position in the French sentence
* TYPE either S (sure) or P (probable)
* PROB the probability of the alignment link

The last two fields are optional, if missing they default to S (sure) and 1.0.

In this format, if something aligns to NULL, it simply does not appear in the file.
